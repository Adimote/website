title: SR2019 Competition Announced
---

We're pleased to announce the 2019 Student Robotics competition!

After a year's hiatus during which we've worked to ensure that Student Robotics
will be more scalable for the future, we're pleased to announce the continuation
of the annual competition.

In order to allow the core team of volunteers to focus on delivering a high
quality programme while requiring far fewer resources than before, this year's
competition will be slightly smaller than previous years. We expect to be able
to increase the size of the competition again in the future.

TODO: something about whether places are available and the number of teams

As before, the competition cycle will start with a number of concurrent
kickstart events at which the game will be announced and the kits handed out to
teams.

This year kickstart will take place on Saturday 10th November in London and
Southampton. We are hoping to add other venues shortly.

The competition will culminate around April at the University of Southampton
(exact dates will be announced at kickstart). Teams will spend two days
finessing and testing their robots as they compete first through a league stage
and then a seeded knockout stage.

Rising to the top of the knockout stages is not the only way to impress the
judges though; prizes will be available in a number of other categories to be
announced at kickstart.
