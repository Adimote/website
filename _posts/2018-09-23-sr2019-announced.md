title: SR2019 Competition Announced
---

We're pleased to announce the details of the 2019 Student Robotics competition!

After a year's hiatus during which we've worked to ensure that Student Robotics
will be more scalable for the future, we're pleased to announce the continuation
of the annual competition.

As before, the competition cycle will start with a number of concurrent
kickstart events at which the game will be announced and the kits handed out to
teams.

This year kickstart will take place on Saturday 10th November in London and
Southampton. We are hoping to confirm other venues shortly.

TODO: will we have confirmed all the venues?
TODO: will we have assigned competitor teams to locations?
TODO: will we have space for more teams?

The competition will culminate on [TODO: DATE] at the University of Southampton.
Teams will spend two days finessing and testing their robots as they compete
first through a league stage and then a seeded knockout stage.

Rising to the top of the knockout stages is not the only way to impress the
organisers though; prizes will be available in a number of other categories to
be announced at kickstart.
