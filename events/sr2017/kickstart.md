The venues for Student Robotics 2017 kickstart are:

- University of Southampton
- University of Bristol
- The Kings Centre, Oxford

Teams are welcome to attend any venue they wish. However; they should inform their local team co-ordinators which venue they will attend, as we will need to arrange for the robotics kits to be at the venue they choose, and some venues have vehicle access restrictions which will need to be arranged beforehand.

Below is an table of venue-dependent information:
