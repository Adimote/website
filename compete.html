          Student Robotics primes participants for good careers in engineering.
          Participants assemble a team, build a robot, and compete. All the while
          gaining valuable technical and soft skills to help their future careers.

          <p>
            For a team to succeed at Student Robotics, it needs to work
            together. For many participants, this is the first time they're in a
            team setting. This practical experience is invaluable for their
            future careers.

          <p>
            Without some serious code, even the most masterfully built robots
            can't do very much. With the help of our kit, teams will program
            their robot in Python to compete in the competition.

          <p>
            There's nothing quite like building something and bringing it to
            life. Using our kit, teams will build a fully autonomous robot. The
            best teams pour their imagination into the design and the look of
            their robots.

          <p>
            At the beginning of the academic year we have an event we call a
            Kickstart. Teams are given their kits and get to do some basic
            exercises to see how it all works. They're also introduced to the
            game they'll be playing at the competition.

          <p>
            Between Kickstart and the Competition we host a series of tech days
            in various locations throughout the UK. Usually hosted on a weekend,
            teams can bring their robots and get some help from volunteers.

          <p>
            In the spring we host a competition for all of our participating
            schools. Teams bring their robots for a weekend of tinkering and
            matches. Successful teams advance into the knockout stages, and can
            go on to win prizes.
