          <h3>Kickstart</h3>
          <p>
            At the beginning of the academic year we have an event we call a
            Kickstart. Teams are given their kits and get to do some basic
            exercises to see how it all works. They're also introduced to the
            game they'll be playing at the competition.

          <h3>Tech Days</h3>
          <p>
            Between Kickstart and the Competition we host a series of tech days
            in various locations throughout the UK. Usually hosted on a weekend,
            teams can bring their robots and get some help from volunteers.

          <h3>The Competition</h3>
          <p>
            In the spring we host a competition for all of our participating
            schools. Teams bring their robots for a weekend of tinkering and
            matches. Successful teams advance into the knockout stages, and can
            go on to win prizes.
