        <h2>Competition dates for SR2016 announced</h2>
        <p>
          The competition venue and dates for SR2016 have now been confirmed.
          Once again the competition will return to the Newbury Racecourse
          Grandstand which has successfully hosted the competition over the past
          two years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The competition weekend will be the 30th April and 1st May. Over the
          two day event the teams' robots will first compete in a series of
          league matches, during which they will continue to improve their
          hardware and software. These matches will then seed a knockout to
          choose the overall winners.
        </p>
        <p>
          In each match the robots will play Sunny Side Up, in which the aim is
          to turn as many of the nine tokens the right way up and then collect
          as many as they can into their home zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the coveted 1st, 2nd and 3rd prizes, there are awards
          for the highest placed new team, the most ingenious robot and the best
          presented team among others. For full details of the rules of the game
          and the prizes available see the rulebook.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're supporting a team or just want to watch, the
          competition is open to everyone over the whole weekend. We
          particularly recommend coming along for the finals on Sunday
          afternoon.

        <h2>Registration for SR2016 now open</h2>
        <p>
          Registration for Student Robotics 2016 is now open and, as always,
          it is completely free to take part. You can register your interest
          in entering a team for the next Student Robotics competition and
          we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The competition will kick off towards the end of October, where
          teams will attend one of our Kickstart events. Teams will be
          introduced to the SR2016 game, the Student Robotics Kit and set a
          series of small challenges to help them familiarise themselves with
          the Kit. Help will be on hand throughout the day from our growing
          team of university and industry mentors.
        </p>
        <p>
          After spending six months carefully designing, constructing and
          testing their robots, teams will come together for the main
          competition in April 2016. Here, their robot will be pitted against
          all of the other teams' robots. Over two days, through a battle of
          minds and engineering prowess, the robots and teams will have to
          prove themselves with reliable and consistent performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, if you have a team of 16-18 year-olds who think they have what
          it takes to be crowned the winners of SR2016, please register your
          interest and we will get in touch with you as soon as we can.
