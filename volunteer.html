  <h2>Mentor teams</h2>

  <p>We send volunteers out to teams to help them with their robot.
    You don't need to be an expert already;
    it's most important to encourage teams to get things done,
    and to help them solve problems.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"I expected it to be more like teaching, but it was more about supporting the teams.
      I think that's a good idea because it doesn't waste their time." — Andy Barrett-Sprot</p>

  <h2>Competition</h2>

  <p>We run three types of event a year: <a href="/events/kickstart">Kickstart</a>,
    <a href="/events/tech_days">Tech Days</a> and the <a href="/events/competition">Competition</a> itself.
    Especially at the competition, we're in need of volunteers for many different roles,
    including setting up, doing safety checks, coordinating teams, scoring games, and many others.
    No previous experience necessary.</p>

  <h2>Development</h2>

  <p>All our software and hardware is open source (see <a href="/git">our Git repositories</a>).
    If you're interested in contributing, pop onto our <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/srobo">IRC channel</a>
    or the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/srobo-devel">srobo-devel</a> mailing list.</p>
