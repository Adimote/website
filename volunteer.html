            Student Robotics is powered by a collection of passionate
            individuals with varying skills from diverse backgrounds. If you're
            passionate about helping us achieve our goal, and you're willing to
            get stuck in, we have a place for you.

          <h3>Mentoring</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the year, teams work to develop their robots. Mentors are
            on the front line with them. Working with one or two teams, mentors
            help teams keep teams on track, and help them find information they
            need to progress.

          <h3>Events</h3>
          <p>
            Kickstart, Tech Days, and the competition all depend on a small army
            of volunteers to run effectively. Whether it's shepherding teams,
            manning the helpdesk, running reception, or orchestrating the
            matches; we're always eager for more blueshirts.

          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            Student Robotics relies heavily on an array of hardware and
            software. Aside from the kit which we lend to teams, there's
            plenty behind the scenes keeping things running, including this
            website! There's always room for more eyes to help us develop and
            maintain it all.
