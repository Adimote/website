            We challenge teams of 16 to 18 year-olds to design, build and develop
            autonomous robots to compete in our annual competition. After announcing
            the year's game, we give teams six months to engineer their creations.
            We mentor teams throughout this time, as well as supply them with a kit
            which provides a framework they can build their robot around. Thanks to
            our sponsors, we provide this all for free to our teams.

          <h3>Kickstart</h3>
          <p>
            At the beginning of the academic year we have an event we call a
            Kickstart. Teams are given their kits and get to do some basic
            exercises to see how it all works. They're also introduced to the
            game they'll be playing at the competition.

          <h3>Tech Days</h3>
          <p>
            Between Kickstart and the Competition we host a series of tech days
            in various locations throughout the UK. Usually hosted on a weekend,
            teams can bring their robots and get some help from volunteers.

          <h3>The Competition</h3>
          <p>
            In the spring we host a competition for all of our participating
            schools. Teams bring their robots for a weekend of tinkering and
            matches. Successful teams advance into the knockout stages, and can
            go on to win prizes.
