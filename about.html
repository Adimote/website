      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>
        Every year we run a competition for students aged 16 to 18. We provide
        teams a robotics kit and challenge them to go away and build a robot in
        time for the competition. The best part is, thanks to our sponsors, it's
        free to enter.

          <h3>Kickstart</h3>
          <p>
            At the beginning of the academic year we have an event we call a
            Kickstart. Teams are given their kits and get to do some basic
            exercises to see how it all works. They're also introduced to the
            game they'll be playing at the competition.

          <h3>Tech Days</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the academic year we host a series of tech days in
            various locations throughout the UK. Usually hosted on a weekend,
            teams can bring their robots and get some help from volunteers.

          <h3>The Competition</h3>
          <p>
            In the spring we host a competition for all of our participating
            schools. Teams bring their robots for a weekend of tinkering and
            matches. Successful teams advance into the knockout stages, and can
            go on to win prizes.
